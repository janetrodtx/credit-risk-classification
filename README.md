Here are the performance metrics for the Logistic Regression model:

Accuracy: 0.9926
Precision: 0.8447
Recall: 0.9402
Summary
The Logistic Regression model performed well in predicting loan statuses with high accuracy, precision, and recall. It is recommended for use, especially because:

Performance: The model works well for both healthy and high-risk loan predictions, with balanced precision and recall.
Risk Consideration: For minimizing financial risk, predicting high-risk loans accurately is key. The modelâ€™s high recall shows it is effective in identifying high-risk loans.
In conclusion, the Logistic Regression model is a reliable choice for predicting loan status. However, depending on your focus (e.g., minimizing false negatives), further adjustments or alternative models may be useful.
